# Webpage HTML Export

## To Do:

- [x] Add an option to export app.css and any .js files internally or externally (internal by default)
- [x] Allow to select an export location.
- [ ] Add a built-in outline on the side of the page.
- [x] Add a built-in lightmode/darkmode switch to the export (would use js).
