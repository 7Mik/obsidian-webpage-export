# Webpage HTML Export

Exports an obsidian document as an HTML document / webpage / website, correctly including all styling and formatting.

## To Do:
- [ ] Make it work.
- [ ] Take out as much unnecesary css as possible from the header and app.css
- [ ] Add an option to export app.css and any .js files internally or externally (internal by default)
- [ ] Allow to select an export location.
- [ ] Add a built-in outline on the side of the page.
- [ ] Add a built-in lightmode/darkmode switch to the export (would use js).
